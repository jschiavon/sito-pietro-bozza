## Personal website

This is my personal website, made thanks to the Unfold Lite template by [UIdeck](https://uideck.com).

### Dice Roller
In the website there is also a small dice roller I made as a proof of concept to help me with one of the Tabletop Role Playing Games I played in, that is licensed with the MIT license on its own.
